            <h3>What is Anime?</h3>
            <p>Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced by it. It is the Japanese term for
                cartoon or animation where the Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of the
                nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that come exclusively from Japan,
                distinguished by blazing graphics, energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi, romance,
                and supernatural forces.Therefore, consider this syllogism: all anime shows are cartoons, but not all
                cartoons are anime.

            <h3>How to become an Anime Animator?</h3>
            <p>Introduced in Japan and increasingly popular in the West, anime describes a style of artwork with a
                unique aesthetic. This animation covers full-motion cartoons in television and video. The anime look
                defines itself not only by visual styles of on-screen characters, including movement and clothing, but
                also by the worlds these characters inhabit. Artists wishing to become anime animators must familiarize
                themselves with this unique style of cartoon as well as develop a comprehensive portfolio.</p>
